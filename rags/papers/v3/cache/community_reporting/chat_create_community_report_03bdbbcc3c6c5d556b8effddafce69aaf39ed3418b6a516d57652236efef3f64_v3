Relationships indicate co-mentions of these civilizations as partners in early medical knowledge, forming a connected network that traces cross-cultural knowledge sharing from Egypt and Mesopotamia to India, China, and Greece. The dataset highlights a concise but interconnected web of five relationships, underscoring the potential breadth of ancient medical knowledge diffusion across regions.
