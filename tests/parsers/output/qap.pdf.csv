Question:​
 What are the main advantages of the AutoDeco heads in transformer models, and how do 
they affect model performance, efficiency, and emergent capabilities? 
Answer:​
 The AutoDeco heads offer several advantages: 
1.​ Performance Improvement: AutoDeco substantially outperforms standard 
non-expert decoding methods like Greedy Search and Default Sampling. It also 
matches or slightly surpasses the performance of optimally tuned static 
hyperparameters.​
 
2.​ Efficiency: The AutoDeco heads are simple 2-layer MLPs, which add only 1–2% 
latency and a negligible memory footprint. This makes integration seamless, allowing 
the model to function as a drop-in replacement without modifying existing generation 
logic.​
 
3.​ Emergent C",/app/tests/parsers/data/qap.pdf,1
"to function as a drop-in replacement without modifying existing generation 
logic.​
 
3.​ Emergent Capability: AutoDeco can interpret natural language commands to 
dynamically adjust its generation style, enabling more intuitive and controllable AI 
behavior.​
 
Additionally, AutoDeco uses predicted hidden states, temperatures, and top-p values to 
internally rescale and filter logits, creating a nuanced interplay between parameters that 
enhances overall generation quality. 
If you want, I can also create a more concise, exam-style QA that focuses only on the core 
mechanism and results. Do you want me to do that?

"Question:​
 What are the key features and innovations of Emu3.5, and how do they improve multimodal 
reasoning, generation, and inference efficiency? 
Answer:​
 Emu3.5 is a large-scale multimodal world model with several key features and innovations: 
1.​ Multimodal Next-State Prediction: It natively predicts the next state across vision 
and language, accepting interleaved vision-language inputs and generating 
interleaved outputs.​
 
2.​ Massive Pre-training: The model is pre-trained end-to-end on a corpus of over 10 
trillion vision-language tokens derived from sequential frames and transcripts of 
internet videos using a unified next-token prediction objective.​
 
3.​ Reinforcement Learning Post-Training: Emu3.5 undergoes large-scale 
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reason",/app/tests/parsers/data/qap.pdf,2

4.​ Inference Efficiency via DiDA: The proposed Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA) 
converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating 
per-image inference by ~20× without loss of performance.​
 
5.​ Strong Multimodal Capabilities: Emu3.5 supports long-horizon vision-language 
generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation.​
 
6.​ Generalizable World-Modeling: The model enables spatiotemporally consistent 
world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios.​
